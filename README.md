AirArm
=========
This is an articulated arm used to direct the flow of air on bench tools (such as scroll saws) to blow saw dust away from the blade. It was designed and
initially installed on a low-cost Ryobi saw from Home Depot, but isn't limited to any particular manufacturer or type of tool. If there's a place to mount
the base, it will work. Even if your tool doesn't have a built-in air pump, you could simply use an external pump like those used on aquariums.

The SCAD files can be used to modify the dimensions of the base and tweak some variables in the end effector (such as tubing diameter and arm length).

Assembly
=========
Print "base.stl", "end_effector.stl", and as many of "BS_Joint.stl" as required to extend the arm to the desired length. Connect the pieces together, and use
double sided tape to attach the base plate to a suitable location on the tool.

If the ball and socket joints are too lose when the tool is operating, they can be tightened by wrapping one or two layers of thin tape (such as packaging tape)
around the ball ends. Alternately, shrink tubing can be used for a more robust result.
